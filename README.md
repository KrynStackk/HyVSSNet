# HyVSSNet

To combat the severe spectrum scarcity anticipated in future 6G IoT ecosystems, this study introduces a streamlined framework for distinguishing between radar and communication waveforms. By utilizing the time-frequency details provided by the Smoothed Pseudo Wigner-Ville Distribution (SPWVD), we developed a Selective State Space Model that operates with linear computational complexity. The core innovation is the HyVSS-Net (Hybrid Visual State Space Network), which integrates a novel hybrid block. This block combines a holistic quad-directional mechanism for understanding global context with a focal mechanism for pinpointing sparse local features, all fused via an adaptive gated channel aggregation module. Experimental results indicate the model is highly suitable for resource-limited edge devices, delivering 90.77% accuracy, a mere 0.60 ms latency, and requiring only 27K parameters.
