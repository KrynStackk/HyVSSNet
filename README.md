# HyVSSNet

This paper tackles the pressing issue of spectrum congestion in next-generation sixth-generation Internet of Things (IoT) networks by introducing an innovative lightweight framework for the classification of integrated radar-communication waveforms. Utilizing the high-resolution capabilities afforded by smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution time-frequency representations, we present selective state space model architectures adept at capturing complex temporal-spectral dependencies, all while maintaining linear computational complexity. 

At the core of our framework is the hybrid visual state space block, which integrates a comprehensive quad-directional state mechanism for global context modeling alongside a targeted quad-directional state mechanism for the extraction of sparse and informative local features. In addition, we implement an adaptive gated channel aggregation module that dynamically fuses these multi-scale representations. 

Comprehensive simulations conducted on a varied dataset of radar and communication signals reveal that the proposed hybrid visual state space network (HyVSS-Net) achieves a remarkable accuracy of $90.77\%$, coupled with an ultra-low latency of $0.60$ ms and a compact model size of $27$K parameters. These results underscore the framework's effectiveness for real-time deployments on resource-constrained edge devices.
